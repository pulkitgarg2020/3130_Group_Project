Group Introduction and experience with android shared  

Discussed the project - Quick cash  

Roles of scrum master and scrum guard  

Assigned the roles and decided that roles would be rotated every week  

User stories  

Logging into the app - authentication  

Wireframe theme - UI for the app that supports the control flow 

As a user to enter a keyword and search for the people who can do the task  

Registration page - wireframes created before  

The database needed to store userâ€™s information 

Account page to check whether its an employer or an employee 

A worker can add what task they can do 

Different types of payment integration for the user to make the payment 

Rate and review both user as well as the tasker  

Notification if there is a new job that is posted and could be also for the user 

Could be device-oriented  

Could be emailed oriented  

User should have the option to choose 

Categorize the job - narrow down the job to a specific type  

Put in your qualifications in your profile  

If electrician then they should be certified  

Would be hard to validate a certificate  

User, as well as the tasker, could message each other on the app 

Discussed if the project is going to be developed to be used in the real world or not 

Question about if we switch to IoS development or is it strictly Android 

Follow test-driven development  

Before writing the functionality, write the test for the actual functionality  

Show the testing by commits in Gitlab 

Would have to put dummy user inputs and then check how the function would perform  

Discussed that refactoring is not required 

Discussed that if user stories are final  

Client TA suggested to break the user stories further  

2nd Iteration for user stories:  

Sort in the urgency of the jobs  

Put filters in the job listings and should be able to save those preferences 

Validate all the user stories with the client TA. 

As a technical client, they would like to know in detail about the user stories to know what exactly developers would be doing  

Refining the user stories more: 

As a user, we would need signup and a login button on the page 

Client TA shared the link to the slides from the lecture to give the group an example on how to break the TA stories  

Acceptance criteria which client should be satisfied with 

Prioritize user experience in development  

Setting up a meeting time for the next weeks 

Good to have and must have  

Must have - needed for basic requirements  

Good to have - not necessarily important 

Refine the user stories and get it validated by the user. 

Question about making the user story really specific or break it down in detail  

The client should be able to understand it simply but it should also be in the detail 

Example of acceptance tests for the login page  

After login test identify kind of user and then acceptance tests for following pages   

Client TA gave the example about his own coop  

The team discussed if they should discuss the user stories right now or later 

Client TA gave what scope of help he can provide  

 
 

Things to work on for the next meeting: 

Refining the user stories 

Study about user stories on our own
